## Description

Hash table implementation with seperate chaining collision handling.
This means that when a new key maps to an already used index of the table, the new value is also stored in that index.

This is achieved by using a linked list inside the hash table structure and simply adding nodes to each index whenever a collision occurs.

The user can retrieve or delete any node on any index.



## TODO

delete nodes
